 
FOLDERS in DATA:

1. cropped UTKFace - all the cropped 512 * 512 images of UTK face.
2. csv- all csv files needed for the project.
3. Subset 150- final high qality 150 images for pre-training.
4. UTKface- original UTKface images.


DATA PREPROCESING: 

1. Crop all images and discard blurry ones from UTkFaces.

2. Create 150 subset of high-quality images for pretraining(In Section 4: Experiments, they say: 150 training images are sampled from FFHQ-Aging...
We used the central age of the true label age group as α in the finetuning prompt.). Not using more images due to resource constraints!!

Example Target Age Groups used for our project for finetuning pre-trained model
0–9 → "0s"

10–19 → "10s"

...

70+ → "70s"

#final subset of 150 images:

Race	Age Groups Covered	Sample Count
Black	0s, 10s, ..., 70s+	up to 35
White	0s, 10s, ..., 70s+	up to 35
Asian	0s, 10s, ..., 70s+	up to 35
Indian	0s, 10s, ..., 70s+	up to 35
Other	0s, 10s, ..., 70s+	up to 35

3. Generating age conditioned prompts in csv(done in FADING research paper)- but we can try more with race if we have time


4. Load image data and tensors into PromptDataset


IMPLEMENTING:

1. Load Pretrained Stable Diffusion
Use diffusers from Hugging Face to load:

    StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4")

Extract and fine-tune only the UNet (just like in the FADING paper)


2. Fine-Tuning (Double Prompt Scheme)
For each image:

Use two prompts:

P_α = "a photo of a 42 year old person" → age prompt

P = "a photo of a person" → neutral prompt

      Optimize for: L = ||SD(Pα) - GT|| - ||SD(P) - GT||

→ This helps the model learn aging features while preserving identity


3. Save The Fine-Tuned Model
Save only the UNet weights (you don’t need to retrain the text encoder or VAE)

This becomes the new specialized FADING model.


4.  Inference & Age Editing
Use null-text inversion to embed a face into latent space

Use prompt editing to apply age changes:
Original prompt: "a photo of a 40 year old person"
Edited prompt:   "a photo of a 70 year old person"
Generate aged images


Testing project results: What can be the quatifiable results in the project-??

1. Using a pretrained age determination model-??
2. What else-?
